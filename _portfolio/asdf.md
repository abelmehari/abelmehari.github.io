**1. Company Description**  
Meta Platforms, Inc. develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, wearables, and home devices worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment's products include Facebook, which enables people to share, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, groups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, audio and video calls, and rooms; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately.
The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality-related products comprising virtual reality hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. Meta Platforms, Inc. was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California.
**2. Company Strategy**   
**1. Make Strategic Acquisitions for Product Diversification**    
Meta's journey shows that each acquisition is carefully planned with a specific goal in mind. For instance, the company acquired Beluga to gain the technical expertise to build Messenger, its instant messaging app. Similarly, it acquired Oculus in 2014 to gain access to the technology and expertise needed to create its virtual reality headsets. The Oculus acquisition helped Facebook diversify beyond social networking services. The company also made acquisitions in emerging areas. For instance, mobile was a growing area in the world of tech. So, Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to gain access to the rapidly expanding user base on mobile platforms.
**2. Pay Attention to Small Details to Enhance User Experience**    
Over the years, Facebook has consistently improved user experience on all its platforms in small yet significant ways. The company introduced new features at regular intervals such as the People You May Know feature or the Facebook Reactions. It also added new features such as video calling to WhatsApp and Instagram. These are just a few examples of the company’s commitment to a better user experience and the results have paid off. Facebook had 100 million users in 2008. In 2018, this figure stood at 2 billion.
**3. Use Profits to Fuel Innovation**    
Facebook's journey shows that its core strategy has always been to generate profit which it utilizes for its innovation strategy. For instance, Facebook used its revenue from advertising to improve the features on its social media platform. They also used their advertising revenue to expand their services by creating new platforms such as Facebook Developer. Now, Meta plans to use the revenue generated from its Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) to fund its investments in virtual reality.
**4. Continuously Innovate to Offer Better Products & Services**    
The company has always used innovation to create products that have never been offered before. When Facebook was launched, no one had ever imagined that social media could connect people from all parts of the world. Brands had never imagined that it would be possible to gain access to user interests so that they could customize their ads for individual users. But Facebook made all of it possible. Today, Meta is making virtual services a reality in ways that have never been possible before. The ability to conceptualize an entirely new class of products and services is what sets Meta apart.
**3. Revenue**    
Meta revenue on average has been $75 billion annually over the last five years. Meta's revenue growth from 2016 to 2020 is 211.04%. the company has 71,970 employees, and the revenue-peremployee ratio is $1,194,456. Meta's peak quarterly revenue was $28.1 billion in 2020(q4). Meta's peak revenue was $86.0 billion in 2020. The company’s annual revenue for 2019 was $70.7 billion, a 26.61% growth from 2018. Meta's annual revenue for 2020 was $86 billion, a 21.6% growth from 2019, finally, the company had its best year with regards to revenue in 2021($ 117 billion).
 
**4. Meta intrinsic Value and valuations**    
In 2021 Meta had a market cap of $1 trillion, making it one of the few companies in the world to reach the $1 trillion threshold, but in 2022 the company would lose more than half of its market cap. To see if this drop is justified, we have to find the intrinsic value of the company and compare it with the market price. Today various sources such as yahoo finance, value line, and stock on market have valued the market price at around $150. We have also analyzed the company using the multistage dividend discount model to see if this is the intrinsic value of Meta.

Intrinsic value (V0)	$140.01 		
To Calculate the intrinsic value of Meta using the multistage dividend discount model (DDM) we have to make a certain assumption. First Meta has not made any dividends in the life of the company, therefore to calculate the value of the company using the Dividend discount model, we have to assume that the company makes annual dividend payments. If we assume that the dividend payout ratio is 60% of the company’s earnings and that the Return on Equity of the firm is expected to be 22.40% in 2022, we can calculate the growth rate of the company using the ROE and the plow back ratio. the plow-back ratio must be 40%. Since the firm growth rate is 8.9%, the second assumption we have to make is that this growth rate is too high and that after 2025 the company will grow at a constant rate of 7%. Following these assumptions, if we use the 30-year treasury bond as the risk-free rate, and the average return on the S&P as the market return, we can see that the intrinsic value of the company is 140.01, which is higher than the company’s price on November 02, 2022($90) therefore according to the multistage DDM we can see conclude that the firm’s stock is undervalued.
**5. Setting up the Target Price**        
Table 2 Target price calculation
Target Price calculation 	
Market price Nov 2, 2022	90.88
Earnings per share 2022 (EPS)	10.3
Current PE ratio 	8.823300971
Forward PE ratio 	 
growth rate (g) DDM model	8.96%
EPS 2023(EPS2022*(1+g))	11.22288
PE ratio 2023	8.097743182
	
Target price= market price *(PE2022/PE2023)	
Target price 	99.022848
The Target price that we calculate here uses the forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio (PE ratio) of 2023 to calculate this ratio we have to use the growth rate that we calculated in 2023. The formula also uses the Market price during the purchase of the stock, and the trailing twelve-month earnings per share expected in 2022. Using both those data we can calculate the current PE ratio for 2022. Following the current ratio, we can also predict the earnings per share for next year using the growth rate we calculated in the dividend discount model. Since both the current pe ratio and the forward-looking ratio are based on speculation by using the growth rate of the DDM model we are considering the lowest possible growth of the EPS we can expect given the company's ROE so far this year. The rationale here is that there are a few risks we have to consider in setting up the target price. First Meta has missed two of the three quarterly earnings per share expectations this year. Second, we all so have to consider the macroeconomic risk that has loomed over the US market during this year., with rising interest rates and the expected recession, we would like to be as conservative as we can in setting up the target price.
**6. Expected and Realized Holding Period Return**     
Table 3 Expected and realized return
EHPR	
Purchase Price 	 $          90.88 
Target Price 	 $          99.02 
Expected holding period return (Er)	8.96%
	
Realized return 	
Purchase Price 	 $          90.88 
Selling price 	 $        109.28 
Realized return 	20.24%
On November 2, we purchased 337 shares of Meta for a market price of 90.88. In over five years Metas stock has not dropped this low the main reason for the drop in market price can be attributed to the company not meeting earning expectations this year. While Meta did not meet investors’ expectations this year, the expectations for Meta might have been set based on the company earnings in the year 2021 where Meta reported $117.93 billion in revenue and $39.37 billion in earnings (the largest reported earnings in the company’s history), although the company was not able to meet those expectations the companies earning are expected to be $28 billion in 2021, therefore, we can predict that the drop in value was too drastic. Metas stock price would bounce back after a couple of days and beat the target price that we set, but the stock stayed stagnant after hitting $109 therefore we concluded that the stock had hit a sealing and sold the stock.
**7. Comparison Between Meta and the SPY Index**     
Table 4 Meta's realized return and the SPY return
Realized return 		SPY return 	
Purchase Price 	 $        90.88 	Price on oct 6,2022	 $ 373.20 
Selling price 	 $        109.28 	Price on November,30 	 $ 407.68 
Realized return 	20.24%	SPY return 	9.2%
As we can see from the above table Meta was able to beat the SPY index by 11%. On October 6 the SPY index price was $373 by the end of November the index had a price of 407.68 an increase of 9.2%. although Meta had a higher return this can be attributed to the overall risk and return trade-off investors expect. Meta stock price started at $331 this year and has dropped to as low as $88, and is currently trading at $119. While the SPY started the year with a Price of $477 and has only gone to as low as $356. Given that Meta is riskier than the SPY index we would expect that the return on the stock would also be higher.
