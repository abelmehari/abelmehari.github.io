About Me
======
Hello, I'm Abel Mehari, and I'm passionate about the world of finance and investment banking. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Finance at Seattle University, where I've maintained an impressive GPA of 3.95/4.00. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in financial modeling, risk management, and business analysis.

My educational path began with a Bachelor of Banking and Finance, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Eastern Mediterranean University. Throughout my academic career, I've had the privilege of serving as the President of the Eritrean Students Society and receiving the Outstanding Student Scholarship for two consecutive years.
In my professional life, I've gained valuable experience in the finance sector through various roles. As a Real-Time Trading Intern at The Energy Authority (TEA), I support power utilities by troubleshooting daily issues, monitoring portfolio strategies, and managing client portfolios in real-time.
I've also contributed to the academic community by working as a Student Circulation Assistant at Lemieux Library and McGoldrick Learning Commons, assisting students and faculty with their research needs.
During my Financial Risk Management Internship at Turkiye Ish Bank, I honed my skills in investment portfolio analysis and regulatory compliance, while my experience as a Banking Fellowship at Koop Bank allowed me to provide top-notch customer service and support branch business development.
Beyond the financial world, I've managed a bakery in Kampala, Uganda, and have experience with inventory management, compliance with food safety regulations, and improving operational efficiency.
With my diverse experiences, technical skills, and language proficiency in English and Tigrigna, I'm ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the financial and banking industry. When I'm not immersed in finance, I engage in extracurricular activities, including participation in international student networking events and advocating for health awareness.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you and exploring opportunities to collaborate and excel in the world of finance and investment banking.
